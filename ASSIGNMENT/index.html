        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            One month ago, I tested a virtual reality headset called the HTC Vive Pre. The Pre was a development kit
            created by gaming behemoth Valve and smartphone maker HTC, and it was one of the most exciting new pieces of
            hardware I’ve had the pleasure of writing about — a device that offered full-body, room-scale VR.

        <h3>Consumer release</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Since its first prototype was announced in early 2015, the Vive has been very clearly a full VR system, not
            just a headset. Besides its heavy black goggles, the system includes a pair of wireless motion controllers
            shaped like cupholders on sticks, and two "lighthouse" towers that are placed at opposite corners of a room,
            shooting fields of lasers for motion tracking. The Vive grew out of a prototype at Valve, and while the
            remotes don’t look much like gaming hardware, they’re designed like a slimmed-down, split-up version of the
            company’s more traditional Steam Controller. Each one has a clicky front trigger, a pair of side bumpers
            that you can press by squeezing tightly, two top buttons, and a smooth trackpad.

        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 3% !important;">The controllers</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The Steam Controller’s trackpad was originally meant to give PC gamers mouse-like precision on a
            console-style controller, but on the Vive controllers, it could easily be replaced by an ordinary d-pad for
            most of the experiences I’ve tried. The best argument for it is aesthetic: it’s the trackpad that elevates
            the Vive controller design from fancy Wii Remote to something truly futuristic; each pad a beautiful little
            circle that looks like a cyberpunk data chip or a pan of expensive eyeshadow. And adding an interface
            element that’s foreign to almost everyone is a great signal that the Vive isn’t just for people who know
            their way around a controller.
